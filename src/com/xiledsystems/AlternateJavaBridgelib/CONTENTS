AlternateJavaBridgelibActivity
 - dummy activity with a small explanation of the library
 
    
AndroidServiceComponent
 - base class for making components that work in services (FormService)
 
Button2
 - Button which has OnInitializeListener implemented. This allows for automatic resizing.
 You must use setMultpliers(widthmultiplier, heightmultiplier); when setting defaults
 for the button (in the define() method)
 
ButtonBase2
 - Base class for buttons. This is actually what implements the OnInitializeListener.
 Buttons, and ListPickers extend from this class. This also has added an event
 for capturing the Up and Down States of a button.
 
Canvas2
 - Modified canvas to implement the OnInitializeListener for auto resizing.
 
Clock2
 - Modified from Clock.java (javabridge). The only difference is that when an
 activity loses focus, the clock will turn it's timer off. This is to prevent
 memory leaks. If you want the clock to continue, use Clock.
 
Clocksvc
 - clock/timer component for services
 
Form2
 - Use this to extend your activities from if you wish to take advantage of the
 components that auto resize. Those components will work just like the java
 bridge ones if put into a regular Form (they won't resize)
 
FormService
 - Base class to use for creating a service. The funtion is very similar to how one creates an
 activity with Java Bridge (Form)
 
Image2
 - Modified version of javabridge's Image.class. This uses a different way to draw
 the image. This allows you to stretch the image any way you want. The default
 javabridge Image only allows stretching if the aspect ratio is kept the same.
 
ImageSprite2
 - This is essentially the same as ImageSprite.class. Only this will automatically shut
 it's timer off when the activity it resides in has lost focus. This is to prevent
 memory leaks. You should know that the timer is re-enabled upon the activity
 being resumed.
 
JsonUtil2
 - Modified version of JsonUtil from the Java Bridge. This is in testing right now. I need
 feedback. This class is used by other components.
 
Label2
 - This has been modified to implement the OnInitializeListener
 
ListPicker2
 - Modified ListPicker class. This uses ArrayList<String> to populate the elements, rather than
 a YailList.
 
 
ListPickerActivity2
 - Activity class used by ListPicker2. This needs to be declared in your manifest if you are
 using ListPicker2.
 
 
LocationSensor2
 - This adds the ability to change the MIN TIME INTERVAL of the gps updates. It's default is
 60000 (60 seconds), but with this component, you can change it. This will be come deprecated
 when the new JavaBridge version comes out. This will get removed then.
 
 
MediaUtilsvc
 - This is modified from MediaUtil in JavaBridge. It's adjusted to be able to work in a
 service.
 
 
Notifiersvc
 - Modified from Notifier (JB) to run in a service.
 
 
OnDestroyListener
 - interface for tapping into a service's onDestroy() method for components within that 
 service.
 
OnInitializeListener
 - interface for tapping into a Form's Initialize method (for auto resizing components)
 
OnStartCommandListener
 - same as OnDestroyListener, only for the onStartCommand() method instead.
 
Picker2
 - Base class of ListPicker2
 
Playersvc
 - Modified from JB's Player class to work in a service. Added new Event thrown "OnStartCommand"
 so one can modify what the player does when the service receives a new intent.
 
ScrollView
 - Base class for srollview.
 
ScrollViewArrangement
 - Like a Horizontal or Vertical Arrangement, only this automatically will scroll. Right now,
 this is only vertical scrolling. Note, this extends from a FrameLayout. So, it's meant to
 hold one thing (however, that one thing can contain multiple other things).
 
Soundsvc
 - Modified from JB's Sound class to work in a service. Added new Event thrown "OnStartCommand"
 so one can modify what the sound component does when the service receives a new intent.
 
Sprite2
 - Base class of ImageSprite2
 
SVArragement
 - Base class of ScrollViewArrangement.
 
  
SvcComponentContainer
 - interface for services to become component containers, thus allowing us to use the 
 modified java bridge components.
 
TextBox2
 - Modified to implement OnInitializeListener for auto-resizing.

Textingsvc
 - Modified from JB's Texting class to work in a service.


TinyDB2
 - Modified from JB's TinyDB class. This saves data to a binary file rather than using
 shared preferences. All uses of YailList were removed. To store lists, use an 
 ArrayList<K>. To retrieve an arraylist, use getList(). Be sure to look at the
 sample to see how it works.


TinyDBsvc
 - Modified from TinyDB2 to work in a service.


TinyListDB
 - Old version. This will be removed soon.
 
TinyWebDB2
 - This is still in testing phase. It works for primitive types such as String, int, etc.
 This hasn't been tested on JSON items yet.

Web2
 - Modified from JB's Web class to work without the need for the kawa library. This
 needs further testing with the JSONTextDecode part of the component. All others
 should function fine.
 
Websvc
 - The same as above, modified to work in a service.
