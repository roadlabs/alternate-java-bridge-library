AlternateJavaBridgelibActivity
 - dummy activity with a small explanation of the library
    
AndroidServiceComponent
 - base class for making components that work in services (FormService)
 
Clocksvc
 - clock/timer component for services
 
FormService
 - Base class to use for creating a service. The funtion is very similar to how one creates an
 activity with Java Bridge (Form)
 
JsonUtil2
 - Modified version of JsonUtil from the Java Bridge. This is in testing right now. I need
 feedback. This class is used by other components.
 
ListPicker2
 - Modified ListPicker class. This uses ArrayList<String> to populate the elements, rather than
 a YailList.
 
ListPickerActivity2
 - Activity class used by ListPicker2. This needs to be declared in your manifest if you are
 using ListPicker2.
 
LocationSensor2
 - This adds the ability to change the MIN TIME INTERVAL of the gps updates. It's default is
 60000 (60 seconds), but with this component, you can change it. This will be come deprecated
 when the new JavaBridge version comes out. This will get removed then.
